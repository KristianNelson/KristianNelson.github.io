title: Fire and Lava Flow Risk Assessment for Expensive Homes in Hawaii
---

This project looks at the risks of lava flow and wild fires that expensive homes in Hawaii face. For this project, I wanted to create a mock-up house insurance quote job that would look at where homes on Hawaii are at most risk. Insurance companies then use these findings to determine whether they want to insure a home or not, and how much the insurance will cost. I specifically looked at lava flow and fire because those were the two variables I was most interested in. Of course, there are many other risks that home owners face in this part of the world. 

The first thing I had to do was gather housing data for the big island of Hawaii. I downloaded parcel data and extracted the homes that were above the average housing price in Hawaii
