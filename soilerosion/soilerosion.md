title: Estimating the Risk of Soil Erosion On the UMBC Campus
---

This was a capstone research project that I worked on my junior year at UMBC. The goal of the study was to possibly highlight areas
around the campus that were at high risk of soil erosion. This could then be used by the UMBC Facilities Management so that they could 
specify areas around campus that needed plantings or some other type of soil stabilizers. The research spanned over 3 months and was the first research project that I undertook by myself.
